      <p className="mb-4">
        I am a Ukrainian-born conceptual artist working primarily in drawing and painting. After moving to the United States, I encountered pop surrealism while visiting galleries in San Francisco. That experience deeply influenced my creative direction, introducing me to a visual language that reflects both dislocation and imagination.

        My work explores themes of memory, migration, and identity through a surrealist lens. Drawing is my way of storytelling, blending personal history with symbolic and dreamlike imagery. Each piece becomes a reflection of belonging and transformation within a layered cultural landscape.
